      <p>A flower is the reproductive structure of angiosperms (flowering plants). It is usually colorful and fragrant, designed to attract pollinators like bees, butterflies, birds, and sometimes the wind.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to connect loving families with flowers in need of a forever home.</p>
